# Nemacounter

## Overview
Nemacounter is a versatile tool designed for object detection, manual edition, and object segmentation using sequentially YOLOv5 Object Detection, OpenCV library and Segment Anything Model. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on using the software through its three main tabs: Object Detection, Manual Edition, and Object Segmentation (see below for a detailed user guide).


## Installation

### Windows

#### 1 - Download and Install Python for Windows:
- If you don't have Python already installed, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) --> Window installer (x64 or x32).
